# Infinite Scroll with Rails and Turbo - No JavaScript

In this tutorial, I will walk you through the process of creating an infinite scroll feature using Rails and Turbo. I wanted to see if using only Turbo was an option for this feature and turns out, it is. I was excited to discover this so I wanted to share the wealth.

I will cover the necessary steps, including setting up the database and handling the server-side logic. By the end of this guide, you will have a fully functional infinite scroll feature in your Rails application that you can borrow on your own.
